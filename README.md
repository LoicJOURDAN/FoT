# Friends of tracking lessons

Friends of tracking is a youtube channel that provides tools to visualise spatial tracking and event data from football (soccer) matches.
Lessons are in python and R but I mainly do python ones at the moment. 

From data exploration to pitch control metrics, I enjoy doing their tutorials and the homeworks associated. 
This work is largely inspired from https://github.com/Friends-of-Tracking-Data-FoTD/

The metrica folder is done with the metrica database that can be found here https://github.com/metrica-sports/sample-data
The statsbomb folder is done with the statsbomb database: https://github.com/Friends-of-Tracking-Data-FoTD/SoccermaticsForPython
